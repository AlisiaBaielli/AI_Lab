The HCC1086_smart_report notebook contains is a description of the project. 
We focused on the MCF7 and HCC1806 cell lines, analyzing both using the SmartSeq and DropSeq techniques. 
In the X_cell files, we have attempted to predict whether cells belong to either the MCF7 or the HCC1806 cell line based on their expressions.
